# Recipe Picker

Recipe picker is a single page application (S.P.A) that helps you organize your recipes. The framework uses the [spoonacular api](https://spoonacular.com/) to search for recipes. This S.P.A gives you the option to save spoonacular's recipes or upload your own recipes. Included is a feature called pick me my meal, where it picks a random meal for you, from either the API or your own recipes. 

This app was developed using the rails framework. If you would like to learn more about rails, please visit https://rubyonrails.org/.

And then execute:
